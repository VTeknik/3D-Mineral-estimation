To estimate a mineral reservoir in 3D, you typically use a series of geostatistical or machine learning methods based on spatial data such as drill-hole assays, geological surveys, and geophysical data. Below is an outline of steps and code components commonly involved in a 3D mineral reservoir estimation:

Steps:
Data Preparation:

Import drill-hole or spatial data (coordinates and values of mineral grades).
Clean and preprocess the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the spatial distribution of mineral grades.
Analyze data statistics and relationships.
Variogram Analysis:

Calculate experimental variograms.
Fit a variogram model to describe spatial continuity.
Gridding and Interpolation:

Define a 3D grid to represent the study area.
Use interpolation methods like Ordinary Kriging, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), or Machine Learning (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks) to estimate mineral grades.
Volume and Tonnage Calculation:

Define cut-off grades for the mineral resource.
Estimate volumes and tonnages based on block grades and densities.
3D Visualization:

Visualize the mineral distribution using 3D plotting tools.
